			<h2>Students against injustice</h2>
			
			An incident happened at GSVM medical college, kanpur.
			Students hold candle march and strikes in many  different
			parts of India. There is protest by students, against
			the alleged high-handedness of city police and
			administration on the junior doctors of GSVM medical college of Kanpur.<br><br>
			
			<h2>Clash between Medical students and MLA</h2>
			
			Students after exam, move back to their hostel
			on  two bikes. Suddenly the students vehicle  was
			hit from behind by Samajwadi Party MLA from Sisamau
			Irfan Solanki  vehicle  as driver of a car was 
			driving on wrong side of the road. The  MLA driver
			and  gunner  assaulted the  students and also damaged
			their vehicle . They said "from where you get the power 
			to hit ths MLA's vehicle ".  It hurted his ego. The  
			"GUNDA RAAJ" didn't end now. In those students,
			one student was physically Disabled.<br><br>

			Later ,MLA, Irfan Solanki supporters and police on
			February 28 has committed brutal attack on the medical
			students, residents and staff of the GSVM medical college,
			Kanpur.  The Police  lathicharged on  junior doctors and
			medical students, was very cruel and ruthless and  senior
			doctors too were not spared and were treated in a very 
			indecent manner.  They damaged all the hostels, vehicles, 
			hospital etc and are still chasing students. <br><br>
			
			<h2>Students and staff got injured </h2>
			
			Almost 400 medical students and junior doctors got 
			injured and a dozen are serious. Thirty-six junior doctors
			were arrested last night after the incident. While 12
			have been released, rest 24 are still in custody and
			cases have been slapped against them.
			Among the students who were seriously injured, one of them
			suffered a pelvic fracture and is in a serious
			condition (he might get paralyzed).<br><br>
			
			To visit  his elder brother, a 14-year old boy has came
			to the hostel. Police has also assaulted and arrested him.
			Due to lathicharged the president of GSVM medical college, who 
			is also a gold medalist was unbalanced and fallen down from
			the second floor. Now. the guy is suffering from a pelvic  fracture.<br><br>
			
			<h2>Protest against the clash </h2>
			
			Many students of different colleges in India are protesting
			against the alleged high-handedness of city police and 
			administration on the junior doctors of GSVM medical college
			of Kanpur. Some colleges went to strikes, while
			others are holiding candle march. We are into a very noble
			profession but when our voices are not
			heard, we have no other option but to go on strike.<br><br>

			AIIMS and IIT kanpur  hold a candle march within the hospital
			premises in protest against the alleged high-handedness
			of city police and administration on the junior
			doctors of GSVM medical college of Kanpur.<br><br>
