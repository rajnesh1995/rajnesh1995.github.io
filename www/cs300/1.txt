Movie Review:
Whiplash 

Apart from being a highly inspirational movie or being a movie that motivates you about achieving your dreams, it also throws some light on how a student-teacher relation is. Throughout the movie, the director tries to show, even if the conditions in which you are surviving are harsh, one can learn from them and motivates oneself to do even better.

This movie depicts the behavior of a music teacher, who is quite strict and scolds the hero of the movie even for small mistakes and a student who is highly passionate about music (drums) despite the teacher being strict and abusive. 

Through the course of the movie, you will feel, how bad the teacher he got is. But eventually in the end you will realize that this movie is surely a depiction of a harsh training scenario, where the struggler will achieve something which is worth the abuses of the teacher. Similar things happen here, where the old strict and abusive teacher acknowledges the hero for what he learnt.

At last, I would like to say it’s a must watch movie for all.
