Importance of Ethics:

Wether you live in a big society or in a community or in any kind of institute, it is expected of you to maintain some
ethics of that place and follow some rules so as to maintain a smooth flow of work and conduction of activities organised. 
Being and intelligent or rich person doesn't make you a good person at all but being co-operative and helpful can.

As in our Computer Science department in IIT Kanpur, these are some of the academic rules which you shouldn't violate:

1. Cheating in exams, copying in assignments makes you a topmost canditate for ethics violation.
2. You shouldn't mark proxy attendence of other students.
3. Hacking servers and making changes to the systems at department building to get good grades is also a serious violation of rules.
4. You shouldn't use unethical methods and foul languages while communicating with others inside department.
